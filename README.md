# Notes for demo:
* tech
    - nodejs
    - mysql
    - reactjs
* stored procedures for high efficiency for important calls
* prepared statements not supported natively by nodejs / mysql2
* api calls
    - public routes (no auth required)
    - private routes
        - admin
        - user
* sessions: using JWT, every api call has 
* authentication: email and OTP sent to emailId, creates jwt and every header has it
* authorization: JWT, different schemes for user and admin
* all input from the user is sanitized using Joi / sanitization
* concurrency: using mysql pool connections, nodejs non-blocking high io event architecture
* changes to original db: many
* security
    - user cannot login with jwt in header and this cannot be faked, generated by lib
    - helmet, which will throttle number of requests
    - cors, which will make sure no cross side can happen
    - deploy, with ssl -> https
* extra:
    - extremely scalable (cluster), high availability (upto 10k users)
    - remove the need for passwords, reset passwords etc
    - all history of the user is available
    - architected in such a way that we do not need any indexes, except the primary for every table
